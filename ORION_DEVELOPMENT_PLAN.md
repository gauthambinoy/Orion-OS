# Orion OS — Master Development Plan

> **Status:** Living document. Single source of truth.
> **Owner:** @gauthambinoy
> **Last revised:** 2026-04-21
> **Audience:** Human maintainers AND AI coding agents (Copilot CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, Devin, etc.)

## 0. How to read this document

This file is the **constitution** of Orion OS. Every decision, every commit, every quality gate is here. If something isn't here, it isn't approved.

- Sections **1–4** are strategy (the "why").
- Section **5** is the architecture (the "what").
- Section **6** is the **commit-by-commit execution plan** (the "how").
- Section **7** is the **AI agent operating manual** — read this before any agent makes a change.
- Section **8** is the growth & launch strategy (the "boom").
- Section **9** is the appendix (decisions, alternatives considered, glossary).

**Update rule:** When a milestone tag is cut, the maintainer updates the "Last revised" date and the milestone status table in §6.

---

## 1. Vision (one paragraph)

Orion OS is an **AI-first, image-based Linux desktop** that is faster, more secure, and more useful out of the box than Windows or macOS — without selling a single byte of user data. Every Orion install ships with a local AI brain that can see your screen, understand your voice, search your files by meaning, and drive your apps — all working offline by default, with optional hybrid cloud routing for heavy tasks. Orion is to "AI desktops" what Tesla was to cars in 2012: not the first, but the first that's actually good.

## 2. Anti-vision (what Orion is NOT)

- ❌ Not a vanilla Linux distro with ChatGPT pre-installed
- ❌ Not a custom kernel or custom DE we maintain from scratch
- ❌ Not telemetry-funded
- ❌ Not "100x better than Windows in 1 month with 200M users" (impossible — see §9.1)
- ❌ Not feature-bloat: 12 hero features done excellently > 200 features done badly
- ❌ Not closed source. GPL-3.0-or-later, period.

## 3. Target users (in priority order)

1. **Privacy-conscious power users** (devs, sysadmins, journalists, researchers) — the same people who run Fedora Atomic, Bazzite, NixOS today. They are our beachhead.
2. **AI-curious creators** (writers, designers, students) who want local AI without learning Ollama/Python.
3. **"I'm tired of Windows" switchers** who tried Linux once, bounced because of friction. Year-2 audience.

## 4. Strategic pillars (what makes us different)

| Pillar | What it means | Why it wins |
|---|---|---|
| **AI native, not AI bolted-on** | Every part of the desktop has AI hooks: launcher, clipboard, terminal, file manager, search, photos, voice. | No competitor does this end-to-end. |
| **Local-first, hybrid optional** | Default: 100% offline AI. User explicitly opts into cloud per-feature with hard spend caps. | Privacy as a *provable* default, not a marketing line. |
| **Atomic + signed + rollback** | OCI image base (Universal Blue), cosign-signed, `rpm-ostree rollback` one click. | An update can never brick your machine. |
| **Hardware-tier aware** | OS detects your tier (low/mid/high/pro) and ships the right model + tuning automatically. | Works on a 2018 laptop AND a 2025 RTX desktop. |
| **Beautiful by default** | KDE Plasma 6 with curated themes, layouts, and fonts. macOS-grade polish out of the box. | Linux's #1 historical weakness, fixed. |
| **Verifiable claims** | Every privacy/perf/security promise is enforced by a CI test. No marketing without a test. | Trust is the only moat. |

## 5. Technical architecture

### 5.1 Stack (frozen — do not change without an ADR)

| Layer | Choice | Why (vs alternatives) |
|---|---|---|
| Base OS | **Fedora Atomic via Universal Blue Aurora** | Atomic, OTA, rollback, KDE-first, 1M+ user proven. (Alternatives: NixOS = too steep learning curve; OpenSUSE MicroOS = smaller community.) |
| Build system | **BlueBuild → OCI → GHCR** | Declarative recipes, free CI, signed by default. (Alt: mkosi = lower level, more work.) |
| Desktop | **KDE Plasma 6** + optional Hyprland session | Modern, customizable, Wayland-native, Kirigami QML for our shells. (Alt: GNOME = less customizable; ours is a customization-first OS.) |
| Kernel | **CachyOS kernel (BORE scheduler)** | Best-in-class desktop responsiveness benchmarks. (Alt: Liquorix, XanMod — CachyOS has the most active dev.) |
| Init | systemd (inherited) | No reason to change. |
| Memory | **zram** (compressed swap) + **ananicy-cpp** | Real perf on low-RAM machines. |
| Power | power-profiles-daemon + custom orion-tune | Battery + perf tuning per tier. |
| Sandboxing | **Flatpak** (apps) + **bubblewrap** (AI features) + **landlock + seccomp** (daemons) | Defense in depth. |
| Security baseline | SELinux enforcing, LUKS2 + TPM2 (passphrase fallback **mandatory**), firewalld strict, DNS-over-HTTPS, signed boot path | Industry best practice. |
| Languages | **Rust** (all daemons/CLI/services) + **QML/Kirigami** (all UI) | Two languages only. Faster onboarding, fewer bugs. |
| AI runtime | **orion-aid** (Rust daemon) wrapping Ollama + llama.cpp + whisper.cpp + Piper + LLaVA + Real-ESRGAN + rembg + Tesseract | Standard, proven, locally hosted. |
| Vector store | **sqlite-vec + age encryption** | Simpler than LanceDB, easier to audit, single file. |
| Cloud routers (opt-in) | OpenRouter, Anthropic, OpenAI, Groq, Together, LAN Ollama | User-supplied keys, stored in KWallet. |
| Installer | Calamares (KDE-native) | Battle-tested. |
| Updates | rpm-ostree + staged channel rollout | Atomic, rollback-able. |
| Telemetry | **None. Zero. Ever.** | Marketing pillar. |

### 5.2 The 12 hero features (v1.0 scope — locked)

Anything not on this list is **post-v1.0**. No exceptions. Plugin marketplace handles the rest.

1. **Orion Copilot** — KDE sidebar. Streaming chat with screen/app context. Encrypted history.
2. **NL Launcher** — `Super+Space` → natural-language → command/app/action. Always confirms before destructive ops.
3. **Screen Sense** — `Super+Shift+A` → describe / OCR / Q&A any region.
4. **Voice Control** — "Hey Orion" wake-word (opt-in, off by default). STT + TTS pipeline. Always-on indicator.
5. **AI Clipboard** — Klipper extension. Explain / translate / rewrite / summarize.
6. **AI Terminal** — Konsole plugin. NL→cmd, error explain, command history search by intent.
7. **Semantic File Search** — Background indexer (idle-only). Search files by meaning, not just name.
8. **Personal RAG** — Chat with your opt-in folders. Per-folder grant/revoke.
9. **Photo Super-Actions** — Dolphin right-click: bg-remove, upscale, describe, OCR.
10. **Translate Overlay** — `Super+T` → live region/text translation.
11. **Meeting Capture** — System+mic audio → offline transcript + summary + action items.
12. **Smart Focus & Power** — DND triage, notification ranking, learned power-profile switching.

### 5.3 Tier matrix (what model each user gets by default)

| Tier | RAM | GPU | Default text model | Vision | Voice STT |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Low** | 8 GB | iGPU | Qwen2.5 3B Q4 | none | whisper.cpp tiny |
| **Mid** | 16 GB | 4–6 GB VRAM | Llama 3.1 8B Q4 | LLaVA 7B | whisper base |
| **High** | 32 GB | 8–12 GB VRAM | Qwen2.5 14B Q4 | LLaVA 13B | whisper small |
| **Pro** | 64 GB+ | 16 GB+ VRAM | Llama 3.3 70B Q4 | Llama 3.2 Vision 11B | whisper medium |

Detected by `orion-tune` at first boot. User can override.

### 5.4 The four AI routing modes (user picks one in first-boot wizard, switchable anytime)

| Mode | Behaviour | Default for |
|---|---|---|
| **Air-Gapped** | 100% local. Network blocked at firewall for orion-aid. CI-verified zero egress. | Journalists, security researchers |
| **Privacy First** | Local first; cloud only for tasks the local model explicitly fails. | **Default for new users.** |
| **Smart Hybrid** | Cost+latency+quality optimizer routes per request. | Power users with API keys |
| **Best Quality** | Always cloud (best available model). | Pro users who don't care about cost |

### 5.5 Non-negotiable quality gates (CI-enforced; release blockers)

A release **cannot ship** if any of these fail:

| Gate | Threshold | Tool |
|---|---|---|
| Boot time (low tier) | ≤ 8 s | `systemd-analyze` in QEMU |
| Boot time (high tier) | ≤ 5 s | self-hosted runner |
| Idle RAM (low tier) | ≤ 1.4 GB | `smem` in QEMU |
| Lynis hardening score | ≥ 90 | Lynis in CI |
| Air-gap leak test | 0 packets out when in Air-Gapped mode | nftables counter in QEMU |
| Voice round-trip latency | < 1.5 s | `tests/perf/voice_latency.py` |
| Cosign signature | All artifacts signed and verified | cosign in CI |
| SBOM | Generated for every image | syft in CI |
| Reproducible build | Same commit → same image hash | rebuild check in CI |
| Hero feature E2E | All 12 pass smoke test in QEMU + real HW runner | `tests/e2e/` |
| Hard spend cap | Cloud spend cap enforced; cannot exceed user limit | `tests/integration/test_spend_cap.py` |
| Unsafe Rust | Zero `unsafe` outside explicitly-audited modules | `cargo-geiger` |

## 6. Execution plan (commit by commit)

### 6.1 Workflow rules

- **M0** (this milestone): direct commits to `main` allowed (repo is empty).
- **M1 onward**: every change is a PR from `feature/<milestone>-<short-name>`, squash-merged, signed commit, signed tag.
- **One commit = one purpose.** Never bundle "add X and fix Y".
- **Conventional Commits** mandatory. Subject ≤ 72 chars. Body explains *why*, not *what*.
- Every commit message ends with `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>` if AI-assisted.
- Push numbering: `P#<milestone>.<n>` — referenced in commit body for traceability.
- **No commit without a passing CI run.**

## 7. AI agent operating manual

> **Read this before any change.** This applies to all AI coding agents working on this repo (GitHub Copilot CLI, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, Aider, Devin, Cline, Continue, Sourcegraph Cody, custom agents, etc.).

### 7.1 Agent identity & permission model

- Agents work on **one push (P#X.Y) at a time**. Never bundle.
- Agents **must read this file first**, locate the next pending commit in §6.3, and only execute that one.
- Agents **never** invent new commits, milestones, or features. Anything new requires a human ADR (see §9.3).
- Agents commit with `Co-authored-by: Copilot <223556219+Copilot@users.noreply.github.com>` (or equivalent for the agent in use).
- Agents **never push to `main` after M0**. Only via PR from `feature/<milestone>-<slug>` branches.
- Agents **never** disable a CI gate to "make it pass". If a gate fails, the agent fixes the code, not the gate.

### 7.2 Mandatory pre-flight checks (every session)

Before writing any code, an agent must:

1. `git status` — confirm clean working tree.
2. `git pull --ff-only origin main` — sync.
3. Open this file, find the next ⬜ pending commit.
4. Verify all dependencies (previous commits) are ✅.
5. Read the relevant subsection of §5 (architecture).
6. Read the security model (`docs/security-model.md`) if the change touches security.
7. Confirm with the user (or session prompt) that this is the right next step.

### 7.3 Style & structure rules

| Rule | Enforcement |
|---|---|
| Rust 2024 edition, `clippy::pedantic` clean | CI |
| No `unsafe` outside modules whitelisted in `audited-unsafe.toml` | `cargo-geiger` in CI |
| `rustfmt` default config | CI |
| QML files pass `qmllint` | CI |
| Shell scripts pass `shellcheck -S error` | CI |
| YAML passes `yamllint` strict | CI |
| Markdown passes `markdownlint` (loose: line length off) | CI |
| Conventional Commits subject ≤ 72 chars | commitlint |
| Every public Rust fn has `///` doc | `clippy::missing_docs_in_private_items` warn |
| Every D-Bus interface has a versioned XML schema in `interfaces/` | manual review |

### 7.4 Testing rules

- Every new feature ships with **at least one** test in the appropriate level:
  - Unit (`cargo test` per crate)
  - Integration (`tests/integration/`)
  - E2E smoke (`tests/smoke/`)
  - Performance (`tests/perf/` — if it touches the perf-budget-enforced paths)
- Every new AI feature ships with an **air-gap test** that verifies it works (or fails gracefully) in Air-Gapped mode.
- Every new feature with a UI ships with a **screenshot test** (PNG diff against golden) — KDE provides `kwin-screenshot`.

### 7.5 Security rules (non-negotiable)

- **No secrets in code.** Ever. Use KWallet at runtime, GitHub Secrets in CI.
- **No outbound network calls** in any daemon unless explicitly routed through `orion-aid`'s router (which respects the user's mode).
- **No `wget | sh`** in any script. Always download, verify checksum, then run.
- **No background telemetry.** Even crash reports must be opt-in and locally previewable before submission.
- **All cloud provider plugins** must support a `dry-run` mode that prints what they *would* send.
- **All AI prompts** sent to cloud providers must be logged to `~/.local/share/orion/cloud-audit.log` (user-readable, auto-rotated, encrypted at rest with user key).

### 7.6 What an agent must NEVER do

- ❌ Add a new dependency (Rust crate, npm package, Flatpak, RPM) without an ADR.
- ❌ Change a quality gate threshold.
- ❌ Disable a CI step.
- ❌ Rewrite history (force-push, rebase shared branches).
- ❌ Modify `cosign.pub`, `SECURITY.md`, `LICENSE`, `CODEOWNERS`, or this plan file without explicit human approval in the PR.
- ❌ Add telemetry of any kind.
- ❌ Add a "small feature" that isn't on the 12-hero list (post-1.0 only).
- ❌ Speed up by skipping tests.
- ❌ Commit binary blobs > 1 MB (use Git LFS or external artifact storage).

### 7.7 When stuck

If an agent cannot complete a commit in 3 attempts:
1. Stop.
2. Document the blocker in the PR description with: error output, what was tried, hypothesis.
3. Mark the commit ❌ blocked in §6.3.
4. Open an issue with label `blocker`.
5. Wait for human input. Do not improvise.

## 8. Growth & launch strategy (the "boom")

> **The honest truth:** No new desktop OS gets 200M users in a month. Set yourself up for the long game and you might genuinely get 100k–1M users in 2–3 years, which is *huge* for a desktop Linux distro. Below is the realistic playbook.

### 8.1 Audience-building (start at P#0.1, not v1.0)

| Channel | What to post | Cadence |
|---|---|---|
| **Devlog blog** (Astro on Cloudflare Pages) | Per-commit micro-posts; weekly long-form deep dive | Weekly |
| **Mastodon** | Build screenshots, polls, milestone announcements | 3×/week |
| **Bluesky** | Same as Mastodon, slightly more polished | 3×/week |
| **Lemmy `/c/linux`** | Major milestones only, no spam | Per tag |
| **YouTube channel "Building Orion OS"** | 5-min build-log per milestone; demo videos for hero features | Per tag |
| **Reddit `r/orion_os`** (own subreddit) | Devlogs cross-posted, community Q&A | Weekly |
| **Reddit `r/linux`, `r/unixporn`, `r/linuxquestions`** | Major milestones only | Per tag |
| **Hacker News** | One Show HN at v0.4 (first beta), one at v1.0 | 2 total |
| **Discord server** | Open at M1 (not M10). Channels: announcements, general, help, dev | Live |
| **Newsletter** (Buttondown) | Monthly summary | Monthly |

**Goal: 1,000 newsletter subs and 5,000 devlog readers BEFORE v1.0 ships.** They are your day-1 user base.

### 8.2 The "killer demo" doctrine

Build the entire v1.0 launch around **ONE 60-second video** that makes the audience *feel* the product. Suggested:

> *Press `Super+Space` → say "summarize the PDF I was just reading and draft an email to mom about it" → 3 seconds later, draft is open in KMail. Network unplugged. All offline.*

Every hero feature must be cuttable into a 15-second standalone video for social. Schedule a video per feature in the 4 weeks leading up to v1.0.

### 8.3 Funding model (decide at M0, not v1.0)

| Source | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| **GitHub Sponsors** | Individual donors $5–$50/mo | P#0.1 |
| **Open Collective** | Transparent finances for grants/companies | M1 |
| **NLnet / Sovereign Tech Fund grants** | €30k–€100k for privacy/security infra | Apply at M4 (working alpha) |
| **Orion Pro** ($5/mo) | Managed cloud AI credits + priority builds + private Discord | Post v1.0 |
| **Hardware partnerships** | Framework, System76, Tuxedo — preinstall deal, revenue share | Post v1.0, after 5k users |
| **Enterprise support contracts** | $$$ for orgs deploying >50 seats | v1.5+ |

**Burn target solo:** ~$1.5k/mo (cloud build, domains, hosting, modest stipend). Cover this with Sponsors+OC by month 6 or stop.

### 8.4 The 12-month launch calendar

| Month | Public milestone | Audience target |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | M0 done; devlog live; "I'm building this" post | 100 readers |
| 3 | M3 done; first boot video | 500 |
| 6 | M4 done = `v0.4.0-beta` first usable AI; Show HN #1 | 5,000; 200 alpha testers |
| 9 | M6 done; voice demo viral attempt | 15,000; 1,000 beta testers |
| 12 | M9 done; RC; press kit to LinuxUnplugged, TechHut, DistroTube, Brodie Robertson | 30,000 |
| 14 | **v1.0 launch.** Show HN #2. ProductHunt. Coverage from at least 3 Linux YouTubers. | **5k–50k installs in first month**, growing to **100k–500k year 1** if quality holds |

### 8.5 Outside-the-box plays (high-risk, high-upside)

These are gambles. Only run them after v1.0 is solid.

1. **"Orion Pro" pre-installed on a partner laptop** — Framework or Tuxedo branded SKU. Revenue share funds the project.
2. **"Bring your own model" marketplace** — community uploads model + tuning recipes; signed and rated. Becomes a moat.
3. **Education edition** — free for schools/universities, with curriculum. Tap into next-gen mindshare. Linux Mint did this poorly; we do it well.
4. **AI-driven distro auto-tune** — Orion ships a "tune my system" wizard that uses local AI to read benchmarks and apply tuning. No other distro does this.
5. **Live OS in a USB sold on Amazon for $19** — for the non-technical "AI-curious" crowd that won't flash an ISO. Margins fund growth.
6. **Public "transparency dashboard"** — live page showing: # cloud calls made by users (aggregated, opt-in), avg spend, % air-gapped users, recent CVE response time. **Trust as marketing.**
7. **Tie a hero feature to a known frustration** — "the OS that finds files you forgot the name of" beats "AI desktop" every time. Pick one specific pain and own it.

### 8.6 What 100/100 looks like at v1.0

- v1.0 ships on time (≤ 16 months from P#0.1).
- All 12 quality gates green at release.
- 5,000+ Discord members; 30,000+ devlog readers; 1,000+ Pro subscribers within 90 days post-launch.
- Coverage in: HN front page, LWN, Phoronix, TechHut, Brodie Robertson, DistroTube, The New Stack.
- One major hardware partner LOI signed.
- One NLnet or STF grant approved.
- Self-sustaining revenue ≥ $5k/mo by month 18.

## 9. Appendix

### 9.1 Why "200M users in 1 month" is impossible (honest math)

- ChatGPT (fastest-growing consumer app ever) took ~2 months to hit 100M MAU — and it's an *app*, not an OS.
- Windows took ~40 years to hit 1B users; Android ~10 to hit 1B; Ubuntu ~15 to hit ~50M.
- An OS requires: driver compatibility (years of work), app ecosystem (decades), user trust (forever), distribution channels (none for indie OSes), and hardware partnerships (slow).
- A realistic best-case for a brilliantly-executed niche AI Linux distro is **100k–1M users in years 2–3**. Bazzite (closest comparable) is at ~100k after ~2 years.
- Setting unrealistic targets causes burnout, panic-shipping bad releases, and reputation damage. **Set the long-game target and over-deliver instead.**

### 9.2 Alternatives considered (and rejected)

| Considered | Rejected because |
|---|---|
| Building from scratch (own kernel/init) | 1000× more work; no practical benefit. |
| Arch base | Less stable for non-power-users; harder OTA story. |
| NixOS base | Steep learning curve for end users *and* contributors. |
| GNOME desktop | Less customizable; Orion's pillar is customization. |
| LanceDB | More dependencies than sqlite-vec; harder to audit. |
| Tauri/Svelte UIs | Adds a 3rd language; Kirigami covers our needs. |
| Telemetry (even opt-in) | Reputation cost > engineering benefit. Document in `SECURITY.md`. |

### 9.3 ADR (Architecture Decision Record) process
